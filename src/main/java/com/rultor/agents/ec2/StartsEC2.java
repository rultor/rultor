 * @todo #629 Implement com.rultor.agents.ec2.StopsEC2 agent. It must
 *  stopped EC2 on-demand instance if it was started at StartsEC2 agent.
 *  StopsEC2 must use instance id from /talk/ec2/[@id] to stop it.
 * @todo #629 RegistersShell must register SSH params "host", "port",
 *  "login", "key" for ec2 on-demand instance, if this one was successfully
 *  started. Successfully start means that these parameters exist in
 *  /talk/ec2
 * @todo #629 Add new instance creation classes for StartsEC2 and StopsEC2
 *  to com.rultor.agents.Agents. StartsEC2 must be invoked before
 *  RegistersShell agent. StopsEC2 must be invoked after RemovesShell agent.
 * @todo #629 Write documentation for configuring ec2 via .rultor.yml at
